# Wether to use hysteresis or not
# Hysteresis adds more robustness to the

# Link quality level
# 0 = do not use link quality
# 1 = use link quality for MPR selection

# Polling rate in seconds(float). 
# Default value 0.05 sec

# TC redundancy
# Specifies how much neighbor info should
# be sent in TC messages
# Possible values are:
# 0 - only send MPR selectors
# 1 - send MPR selectors and MPRs

# Olsrd plugins to load

# - /lib, followed by /usr/lib

    # If a certain route should be preferred or ignored by the mesh, the

    # ignored.  A multiplier of 0.5 will result in a small (bad) LinkQuality
    # value and a high (bad) ETX value.  Note: Link quality multiplier is
