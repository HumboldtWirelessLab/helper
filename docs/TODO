- remove roofnode stuff (roofnode.sh, ssh.conf) replace this by routing

- directory for marker, which should be clear before setting a new one. Problem with different measurement (e.g tcp -> receiver -> tcp)
- outdoorevalution: change in mes-file needs update for evaluation
- ns2: radiomodell (update, correct value, etc.)
- measurement: better log-support for kclick (seems to me, that now there are some lines missing)
- remove 'echo -n ""' in host/bin/function.sh, this is necessary for wgt at University

-Check recommentmodotions if node has more than one device ? WHat if there are different.
-check whether modoptions(countrycode) allow the wanted channel(s).
