- directory for marker, which should be clear before setting a new one. Problem with different measurement (e.g tcp -> receiver -> tcp)
- outdoorevalution: change in mes-file needs update for evaluation
- ns2: radiomodell (update, correct value, etc.)
- measurement: better log-support for kclick (seems to me, that now there are some lines missing)
- remove 'echo -n ""' in host/bin/function.sh, this is necessary for wgt at University
- at BASEDIR which points to the base of the framework
